# Actual Budget - Development Guidelines

## Company Standards & Best Practices

### Code Style

- **TypeScript First**: Always use TypeScript for new files. We maintain strict type safety.
- **Functional Components**: Use React functional components with hooks, not class components.
- **No Console Logs**: Remove all `console.log` statements before committing. Use our logging utility instead.
- **Descriptive Names**: Variables and functions should be self-documenting. Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood (e.g., `userId` not `uid`).

### Security Standards

- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs on both client and server.
- **Budget Data Privacy**: Budget data is sensitive - treat it with appropriate security measures.

### Performance Guidelines

- **Bundle Size**: Monitor bundle size. New dependencies require team approval.
- **Lazy Loading**: Use code splitting for large components and routes.
- **Database Queries**: Optimize SQLite queries - avoid N+1 queries.

### Git Workflow

- **Branch Naming**: Use format `feature/description`, `fix/description`, or `refactor/description`
- **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **PR Reviews**: All code requires at least one review before merging.

### Architecture Principles

- **Local-First**: Design features to work offline first, sync later.
- **CRDT-Based**: Budget calculations use CRDTs for conflict-free synchronization.
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Server should never have access to unencrypted budget data.

## Project Structure

- `packages/loot-core/` - Core budget calculation engine
- `packages/desktop-client/` - React UI components
- `packages/desktop-electron/` - Electron wrapper
- `packages/api/` - JavaScript API for external integrations

## Getting Help

- Check `/docs` for detailed documentation
- Ask in #engineering channel for technical questions
- Review existing patterns before implementing new features
